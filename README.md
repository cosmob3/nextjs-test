# The NextJS journey...

should've been documenting from the beginning but I am only doing it at the end.

It was fun learning NextJS by watching tutorials and being curios. Added some random customizations to test out tailwind and used ChatGPT to figure out an issue with importing components. Out of date information in tutorial but was able to figure it out nonetheless.

Will look into making my portfolio website using NextJS. I've enjoyed it!
